# Evosim - Artificial life simulation
## Introduction
This is a proof of concept executed with the intention of realising how capable today's computing power is in the simulation of 3D artificial genepools, which are likely to contain many rigidbodies.

The program is intended to be a 'toy'. It is not a scientific tool or a true reflection of evolution in the natural world.
