# Evosim - A three-dimensional, real time simulation of natural and sexual selection in an artificial gene-pool.
## Introduction
This is a proof of concept executed with the intention of realising how capable today's computing power is in the simulation of 3D artificial genepools, which are likely to contain many rigidbodies.

The program is intended to be a 'toy'. It is not a scientific tool or a true reflection of evolution in the natural world.

## Usage
Clone this repository and open the directory as an existing project in Unity3D. There may be warnings/errors as the project is run in the editor; this is due to Components needing to be attached to objects. In the near future the only Component you'll need to attach to any GameObject will be the Main script to the Main GameObject as everything else will be done through script.
